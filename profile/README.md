## [About Us](https://thetradehub.net/info/about)

The founder of Trade Hub had a visionary idea to build a multi-platform community for all traders alike. With the year 2020 approaching and the economy and jobs on hold, there was a surge in  [retail investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retailinvestor.asp)  looking to generate income to cover lost hours or make up for temporary business shutdowns at an ideal time with the market dip that made stocks cheaper to buy and the ability to invest with small amounts. With all eyes on the [/r/wallstreetbets subreddit,](https://theprint.in/theprint-essential/the-gamestop-story-how-a-group-of-investors-on-reddit-gave-wall-street-a-wild-week/595181/)  new traders reported losing their life savings, investing blindly due to FOMO, or "Fear of Missing Out," and having no prior experience or practicing due diligence. This is where Trade Hub comes into play, properly pointing new traders in the right direction for stock market investing and daytrading, showing the way for users who want to start the journey of becoming successful independent investors. Aside from showing new traders how to learn the ropes of the stock market, we provide quality trade alerts from experienced analysts with high win rates and returns. Calling out stocks or options plays based on the stock and entry price, followed by trim updates, and finished with a close alert. We find that new traders rapidly increase their knowledge and experience when following these alerts. With the hype of crypto and NFTs, we expanded into the area of trading cryptocurrencies. Providing the same teachings and how-tos for stock investors that help them navigate the difficulties of trading crypto.  
  
Trade Hub didn't stop there. Our team put in lengthy and difficult hours developing a platform for traders, built by traders, that allows traders to input their trades and offer their personal callouts for trade positions. Our system records traders' positions, tracks data, calculates statistics, scores traders based on their performance, and ranks them accordingly on a system-wide leaderboard. Traders can follow others, receiving push notifications when their favorites input a new trade, allowing them to copy the trade. We implemented a reputation system for traders to give positive karma points to others if they benefited from a play or wanted to show respect for the top or upcoming traders. By displaying users' trade stats, followers, and reputation, top traders can stand out and others can know who might be a good choice to follow.  
  
Our users have the ability to earn through our system in a number of ways. Integrated into our system is a feature for traders to tip crypto to others. Monthly, top-ranked traders have access to prize pools at the end of each month. These may be items from our merchandise shop, sponsored prizes, or the possibility of cash winnings. As we develop more features, users will have the option to contribute in various ways to earn rewards.
